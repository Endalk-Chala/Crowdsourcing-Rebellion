## **Overview**

This repository hosts the data, code, and visualizations for the research project titled **“Crowdsourcing Rebellion: Digital Diasporas and Insurgent Financing in Ethiopia.”** The project investigates how Ethiopian insurgent groups—specifically the **Fano militia**, the **Oromo Liberation Army (OLA)**, and the **Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF)**—utilize digital fundraising platforms and transnational networks to mobilize financial support, shape political narratives, and sustain resistance operations.

Preliminary results were presented at the **International Studies Association (ISA) Conference in March 2025**, and the final study is forthcoming in *Civil Wars Journal*.

## **Research Context**

The digital transformation of insurgent strategy is reshaping how rebel movements finance operations, build legitimacy, and engage with diaspora supporters. Ethiopia’s post-2018 political trajectory—characterized by deepening ethnic cleavages and escalating conflict in the **Amhara**, **Oromia**, and **Tigray** regions—presents a unique case to explore this phenomenon. Each of these regions has become a hub of insurgency, while also anchoring **active and politically engaged diaspora communities** in North America and Europe.

This research analyzes **39 GoFundMe campaigns** launched between 2019 and 2024 by diaspora communities affiliated with these regions:
- **12 campaigns** connected to the **Amhara diaspora** (largely in support of Fano),
- **11 campaigns** tied to the **Tigrayan diaspora** (supporting the TPLF during its period of armed resistance),
- **16 campaigns** initiated by the **Oromo diaspora** (in alignment with OLA-affiliated or sympathetic initiatives).

## **Theoretical Framework**

The study is grounded in two conceptual frameworks:
- **Violence Entrepreneurs** (Grove, 2017): Examining how insurgent actors transform digital visibility and affective solidarity into political capital and operational resources.
- **Networked Framing** (Meraz & Papacharissi, 2013): Understanding how digital platforms facilitate decentralized meaning-making, allowing diasporas to co-construct insurgent narratives.

We build upon prior research on rebel financing and diaspora mobilization (Lyons, 2007; Mampilly, 2011; Orjuela, 2008; Staniland, 2012) to trace how platforms like **GoFundMe** and **social media channels** are transforming traditional conflict economies.

## **Research Questions**

1. **How do insurgent groups use diaspora-facing digital platforms to appeal for financial support during the Ethiopian conflicts (2019–2024)?**
2. **What strategies do diaspora communities employ to frame and mobilize fundraising efforts in response to these appeals?**
3. **How do narrative frames—such as victimhood, nationalism, and resistance—vary across ethnic and regional lines (Amhara, Tigray, Oromia)?**
4. **What implications do these campaigns have for transnational political mobilization and the legitimacy of insurgent groups?**

## **Data and Methods**

This repository includes:
- **Scraped and cleaned data** from 39 GoFundMe campaign pages, including donation amounts, timestamps, donor names (when public), and comment text.
- R scripts for:
  - Network visualization of donor-comment keyword relationships
  - Comparative bar charts for total funds raised and number of donors per campaign
  - Text tokenization and thematic clustering by campaign and region
- Annotated visual outputs for use in academic papers and presentations

The project also applies **qualitative coding** to narrative content, focusing on how terms like *genocide*, *resistance*, *freedom*, and *diaspora duty* recur across ethnic contexts.
