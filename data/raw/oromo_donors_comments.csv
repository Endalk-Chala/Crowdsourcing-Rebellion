Tesfa Gemeda,200,"I am donating not to necessarily meet the immediate high demand of a nation under military, political, economic and psychological siege. It is just to express my symbolic and emotional gestures of being on the side of the victims of nature and political ideology of an empire."
Negussie Debella,200,these are innocent the people suddenly attacked by fascist Amhara Fano and forced to leave their homes and everything they have saved for years to save their lives. They are currently suffering in camps without shelter and enough food to sustain their families.

Garbi Yaballo,1000,"In recent years, the Nefetenga taunted, “Let the Tigrayans bow down before us; the rest (the Oromo and the southern clans) are but rubble.” Today, their sneer has shifted to, “Let the Wellega bow down before us ; the remaining Oromo clans are mere debris.”

But for all Oromo—especially in solidarity with the Wellega—this isn’t about elections. It’s about safeguarding our dignity and self-respect. Let us unite to honor our people and uphold our Oromo pride."

Those of you who mourn the displacement of our people and bear irreversible sacrifices for the Wallega community—stop blaming each other and unite. The only true enemy among Oromo is the struggle for the throne. Why quarrel over power when it rightfully belongs in Oromo hands? Why fight instead of reclaiming authority that outsiders have held for 150 years? Let us resolve our differences and stand together! I love you, Wallega"
